## Introduction

The POS (Point of Service) platform provides a versatile REST interface designed for app developers who want to build customized food ordering solutions.

These applications can support a variety of functionalities, including tableside ordering, self-service kiosks, and staff tablets for order taking.

Additionally, the API simplifies inventory management, allowing staff to track stock levels, create dishes and menus, and generate reports efficiently.
