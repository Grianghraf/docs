description: "Ordering dishes."
---

Patrons use the food ordering app to browse the menu and place an order:

1. Browse the food app.

   Patrons browse the food app to get a list of dishes. The patron clicks on a category tab to view the dishes in the category ( **Appetizer**, **Main Course**, **Dessert**, **Drinks**).
2. Verify ingredient quantities.

   The client app checks the inventory has the necessary ingredients before displaying dishes in the UI. Each dish references ingredient IDs, identifying essential ones. If an essential ingredient is out of stock, the UI disables dish selection.
3. View dish details.\
   Patrons select dishes to get more information.
4. Add dishes to the order.

   Patrons can add their chosen dishes to their order. The client app tracks the dishes until the patron places their order.
5. Place an order.

   When they have finished selecting dishes, patrons can place their order. The client app places the order.
6. Order confirmation.

   Once order is placed, the patron receives confirmation and the order details are sent the restaurant staff to begin preparing the order.
