description: "Preparing and prioritizing orders."
---

Station staff use the kitchen display system (KDS) to view orders for their station, prepare the dishes, and set dishes as "Ready for Assembly".

Expeditors oversee the order by setting the priority and status of the order  and assembling the order.

1. View new orders.

   Expeditors get a list of all new orders on the KDS.
2. Prioritize.

   Expeditors adjust the priority of the order between 1-5, with 1 requiring immediate attention.
3. Initiate order preparation.\
   Expeditors initiate the order preparation by setting the status to "In Progress". Each dish is then assigned to the relevant station.
4. Prepare the order by station.

   Station staff view the dishes in the order for their station and begin preparing the order.
5. Displaying dish ingredients.

   Station staff get a list of ingredients for each dish.
6. Set dishes as "Ready for Assembly".

   Station staff set dishes as "Ready for Assembly" when dish preparation is complete.
7. Assemble the order.

   Expeditors assemble the order from the completed dishes.
